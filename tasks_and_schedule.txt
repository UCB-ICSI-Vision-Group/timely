Unscheduled
---
- include discussion of learned weights, with pictures
- what's up with the curves being slightly different in the figures in the paper, even though they're supposed to be the same thing?
- implement and launch run with support vector regression @sergey
- understand the inference behavior: why linear? @tobi @sergey
- run on PASCAL VOC 2011 (test on val)
- optimized inference of marginals, with controlled caching and potentially regression approximation @tobi @sergey
- more proper entropy computation, probably by sampling @tobi
- paper draft with the above things and tighter story/intro @sergey
- finished paper draft with the following improvements over eccv12:
  - modified class value results
  - discussion of inference time and tradeoffs
  - better entropy calculation
  - inverse RL from oracle to learn the policy
  - LSPI?
- separating actions by region
- running on whole dataset instead of only inside of an image

## ideas
- using a saliency map:
  - generate sliding window proposals by combining a saliency map with the object likelihood map
  - score jumping window proposals with a saliency map
- plot recall vs. #windows for a class given other class presence or scene prior--to show that single-class detector efficiency improves with additional data received--which reduces its expected time
- general philosophy of particle filtering/coarse-to-fine vs. cascade: instead of rejecting regions a priori, look only in a few regions and let that guide the next places you look
- evaluate the "valley" of detectors: what's the minimal overlap required to successfully get the detection?
  : in terms of pascal overlap, for example

### assorted
- check code with pylint and pyflakes
- include values for object classes (reference some paper by Ashish if can find) @sergey
- code up LSPI @sergey
- code up 'ranking svm policy'
- include scene context action

#### window proposals
- speed up: profile code to see where the speed bottlenecks are. how can they be resolved?
- try using x_scaled instead of x_frac for window proposal statistics
#### window classifier
- port sub's code into scikits-learn
#### jumping windows
- ensure performance at published levels
- is VQ performance adequate? should be pretty fast
