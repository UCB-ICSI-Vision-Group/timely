Unscheduled
---
- work out the empirical counts inference model and include in paper as a fast approximation, since the results are so similar @sergey
- implement and launch run with support vector regression @sergey
- understand the inference behavior: why linear? @tobi @sergey
- run on PASCAL VOC 2011 (test on val)
- optimized inference of marginals, with controlled caching and potentially regression approximation @tobi
- more proper entropy computation, probably by sampling @sergey @tobi
- running on whole dataset instead of only inside of an image
- stick VJ face detection in there as a quick person class detector

Schedule

23 May - Wednesday
x implement region-splitting for the external detector, expanding the action space, and launch training of corresponding SVMs and MRF model. @tobi

24 May - Thursday
x learn MRF with region-based structure to be able to learn spatial correlations @tobi

25 May - Friday

26 May - Saturday

27 May - Sunday
x change final evaluation to not be multi-class and to weight mean AP by class values @sergey
- paper:
  x put in the cooccurence figures in the paper and a couple of sentences explaining the statistics of the dataset

28 May - Monday
x launch run of current system with inverse-prior class values @sergey
x launch run of current system with the GIST action @sergey

29 May - Tuesday
x process results from last night's runs
x improve the features and fix some bugs in the GIST feature, and re-launch runs

31 May - Thursday
- polish paper

1 Jun - Friday

Tasks

## ideas
- using a saliency map:
  - generate sliding window proposals by combining a saliency map with the object likelihood map
  - score jumping window proposals with a saliency map
- plot recall vs. #windows for a class given other class presence or scene prior--to show that single-class detector efficiency improves with additional data received--which reduces its expected time
- general philosophy of particle filtering/coarse-to-fine vs. cascade: instead of rejecting regions a priori, look only in a few regions and let that guide the next places you look
- evaluate the "valley" of detectors: what's the minimal overlap required to successfully get the detection?
  : in terms of pascal overlap, for example

### assorted
- check code with pylint and pyflakes
- include values for object classes (reference some paper by Ashish if can find) @sergey
- code up LSPI @sergey
- code up 'ranking svm policy'
- include scene context action

#### window proposals
- speed up: profile code to see where the speed bottlenecks are. how can they be resolved?
- try using x_scaled instead of x_frac for window proposal statistics
#### window classifier
- port sub's code into scikits-learn
#### jumping windows
- ensure performance at published levels
- is VQ performance adequate? should be pretty fast
