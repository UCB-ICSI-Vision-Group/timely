9 May - Wednesday

11 May - Friday
- refactor
  - rename 'synthetic' to 'timely' everywhere
- understand the inference behavior: why linear? @tobi @sergey
- results for current system with modified class values @sergey
- finished implementation of "active classification" model @sergey
- run on PASCAL VOC 2011 (test on val)
- results with the GIST action @tobi
- optimized inference of marginals, with controlled caching and potentially regression approximation @tobi @sergey
- implementation of inverse RL to learn policy @sergey
- more proper entropy computation, probably by sampling @tobi
- paper draft with the above things and tighter story/intro @sergey
- finished paper draft with the following improvements over eccv12:
  - active classification model baseline
  - modified class value results
  - discussion of inference time and tradeoffs
  - better entropy calculation
  - inverse RL from oracle to learn the policy
  - LSPI?
- separating actions into regions as well

15 May - Tuesday

18 May - Friday

25 May - Tuesday

1 Jun - Friday
- polish paper, pretty up figures

Tasks
---
### assorted
- check code with pylint and pyflakes
- include values for object classes (reference some paper by Ashish if can find) @sergey
- code up LSPI @sergey
- code up 'ranking svm policy'
- include scene context action

#### window proposals
- speed up: profile code to see where the speed bottlenecks are. how can they be resolved?
- try using x_scaled instead of x_frac for window proposal statistics
#### window classifier
- port sub's code into scikits-learn
#### jumping windows
- ensure performance at published levels
- is VQ performance adequate? should be pretty fast
