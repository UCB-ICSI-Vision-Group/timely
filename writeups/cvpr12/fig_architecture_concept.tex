  \caption{Most object detection approaches have three parts: region proposal, region evaluation, and post-processing of detections. The parts are in a sense sequential, which leads to the influence of cues like context being deferred to the post-processing stage, and to a dependency of early detections on the goodness of proposals. We present a system that considers region proposal and evaluation jointly, such that it is able to output the best detections early in the process.}
