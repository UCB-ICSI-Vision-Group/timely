\section{Optimizing the Single-class Detector}
- generalized detector model: window proposal to classifier to postprocessing

\subsection{Window Proposals}
- to increase speed, need fewer proposals

- stride, coverage of scales and aspect ratio parameters in a sliding window detector (or jumping window)

- novelty: can sample windows according to data

We experiment with the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
The training, validation, and testing sets respectively contain 2501, 2510, and 4952 images.
We do not include objects marked as ``difficult'' in the ground truth annotations.


\subsection{Classifier}
- classifier power: linear vs. rbf

- can do lots of plots: to show that can get same performance given less time than if we werenâ€™t fitting our windows to the data (not sure if this is true)
