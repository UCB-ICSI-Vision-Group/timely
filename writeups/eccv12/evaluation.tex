\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}
- show that the greedy policy works better than random and better than fixed-order

- show that the reinforcement learning policy works better than greedy, at least for the non-infogain rewards.

\subsection{Classification}

\subsection{Detection}
We also evaluate using the task of detection (see \autoref{sec:problem}).
