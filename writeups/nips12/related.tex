\section{Recognition Problems and Related Work}

We deal with a dataset of images $\mathcal{D}$, where each image $\mathcal{I}$ contains zero or more objects.
Each object is labeled with exactly one category label $k \in \{1, \dots, K\}$.

The multi-class, multi-label \textbf{classification} problem asks whether $\mathcal{I}$ contains at least one object of class $k$.
We write the ground truth for an image as $\mathbf{C}=\{C_1,\dots,C_K\}$, where $C_k \in \mathbb{B} = \{0,1\}$ is set to $1$ if an object of class $k$ is present.

The \textbf{detection} problem is to output a list of bounding boxes (sub-images defined by four coordinates), each with a real-valued confidence that it encloses a single instance of an object of class $k$, for each $k$.
The answer for a single class is given by an algorithm $\emph{detect}(\mathcal{I},k)$, which outputs a list of sub-image bounding boxes $B$ and their associated confidences.

The answer is evaluated by plotting precision vs. recall across dataset $\mathcal{D}$ (by progressively lowering the confidence threshold for a positive detection).
The area under the curve yields the Average Precision (AP) metric, which has become the standard evaluation for recognition performance on challenging datasets in vision \cite{pascal-voc-2010}.
A common measure of a correct detection is the PASCAL overlap: two bounding boxes are considered to match if they have the same label and the ratio of their intersection to their union is at least $\frac{1}{2}$.

To highlight the hierarchical structure of these problems, we note that (1) the confidences for each sub-image $b \in B$ may be given by $\emph{classify}(b,k)$; (2) correct answer to the detection problem also answers the classification problem.

Multi-class performance is evaluated by averaging the individual per-class AP values.
Since our use case is motivated by a potential advertising system, we generalize this metric to a weighted average, with the weights set by the \emph{values} of the classes.

\subsection{Related Work}
The literature on object recognition is vast.
Here we briefly summarize work that sufficiently contextualizes our contribution.

\paragraph{Single-class detection}
The best recent performance has come from detectors that use gradient-based features to represent objects as either a collection of local patches or as object-sized windows \cite{Dalal2005,Lowe2004}.
Classifiers are then used to distinguish between featurizations of a given class and all other possible contents of an image window.

Window proposal is often done exhaustively over the image space, as a ``sliding window''.
Using ``jump windows'' (window hypotheses voted on by local features) as region proposals is another common idea~\cite{Vedaldi2009,Vijayanarasimhan2011}.
For local feature-based approaches, a bounded search over the space of all possible windows works reasonably well~\cite{Lampert2008a}.

None of the best-performing systems treat window proposal and evaluation as a closed-loop system, with feedback from evaluation to proposal.
Some work has been done on this topic, mostly inspired by ideas from biological vision and attention research~\cite{Butko2009,Vogel2008,Paletta2005}.

\paragraph{Context}
Context has a foundational role in vision.
One source of context is the scene or other non-detector cues; the most common scene-level feature is the GIST \cite{Oliva2001a} of the image.
For the commonly used PASCAL VOC dataset \cite{pascal-voc-2010}, GIST and other sources of context are quantitatively explored in~\cite{Divvala2009}. 

Another source is inter-object context, shown to be useful for improving detection \cite{Torralba2004}.
A critical summary of the main approaches to using context for object and scene recognition is given in \cite{Galleguillos2010}.

\paragraph{Multi-Class Detection}
Work on inherently multi-class detection focuses largely on making detection time sublinear in the number of classes through sharing features \cite{Torralba2007,Fan2005,Razavi2011}.
A proposed post-processing extension to detection systems uses structured prediction to incorporate multi-class context as a principled replacement for the common post-processing step of non-maximum suppression \cite{Desai2009}.

\paragraph{Cascades}
An early success in efficient object detection used simple, fast features to build up a \emph{cascade} of classifiers, which then considered image regions in a sliding window regime \cite{Viola2001}.
Although the simple features and classifiers of this method have been surpassed by more complex detectors, the idea of cascading classifier evaluations is still often used.
Most recently, cyclic optimization has been applied to optimize cascades with respect to feature computation cost as well as classifier performance \cite{Chen2012}.

However, cascades are not dynamic policies---they cannot change the order of execution based on observations obtained during execution, which is our goal.

\paragraph{Anytime Algorithms and Active Classification}
Anytime performance in vision systems is a surprisingly little-explored idea.
A recent application to the problem of visual detection picks features with maximum value of information in a Hough-voting framework, and explicitly evaluates performance vs. time \cite{Vijayanarasimhan2010}. 

There has also been work on active classification \cite{Gao2011} and active sensing \cite{Yu2009}, in which intermediate results are considered in order to decide on the next classification step.
This line of work is closest to our approach.
Most commonly, the scheduling in these approaches is greedy with respect to some quantity such as expected information gain.

In contrast, we are able to learn policies that take actions without any immediate reward.
