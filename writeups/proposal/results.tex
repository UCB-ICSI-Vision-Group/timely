\section{Results}

We want to show two things: 1) given the same amount of time as our baseline systems, we perform at least as well as them; 2) in the AP vs. time evaluation, we do better than all baselines.

\begin{description}
  \item[Cascaded DPM Baseline~\cite{Felzenszwalb2010b}] We should do as well as it does in the same time ($\approx$0.5 sec), and better than it for shorter times than that.
  \item[Coarse-to-fine Baseline~\cite{Pedersoli2011}] Same thing.
\end{description}

We should think of ways to make the comparison fair.

Should we run the multi-class NMS~\cite{Desai2009} over the detections of the baselines?
Since our approach relies on it, it seems that we should; on the other hand, it's part of the special sauce of our approach.

To make sliding window detectors run faster, we can modify the stride or scale quantization of their sliding window.
So, if we want to output detections in 0.1 seconds, we can modify the Cascaded DPM code, for example, to cover the image in that long.

\aside{
We should also evaluate on some kind of video object detection, to showcase the attentional priors.
Could be an easy CVPR'12 submission.
