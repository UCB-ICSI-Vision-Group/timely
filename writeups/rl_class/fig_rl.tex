  \caption{Some initial experiments using LSPI to solve the toy problem described here. The approach easily learns to find one object at a fixed location, and performs well with random single-object placement. It does not recover multiple objects at fixed locations successfully, and sometimes struggles when they are randomly placed. These are initial experiments, in ongoing work.}
